# Beans

Objects managed by Techno are called beans. Techno is responsible for
instantiating, assembling and returning bean instances. Techno is aware of
the bean life-cycle and knows how to create a bean and its dependencies.

Beans can be marked as being singleton instances, lazy instances and
can be scoped to the current request or the current session.
