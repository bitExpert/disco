# Basic concepts

## #[Bean] and #[Configuration]

The central artifacts used in Disco's PHP based configuration language are `#[Configuration]`-attributed classes and `#[Bean]`-attributed methods.

The `#[Bean]` attribute is used to indicate that a method instantiates, configures and initializes a new object which is managed by Disco.

Attributing a class with `#[Configuration]` indicates that its primary purpose is as a source of bean definitions. The simplest possible `#[Configuration]` class would read as follows:

```php
<?php

use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Configuration;

#[Configuration]
class MyConfiguration
{
}
```

## Using the #[Bean] attribute

To declare a bean, simply attribute a method with `#[Bean]`. You use this method to register a bean instance within Disco of the type specified as the methodâ€™s return value. The bean identifier is the method name. The following is a simple example of a `#[Bean]` method declaration:

```php
<?php

use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Bean;
use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Configuration;
use bitExpert\Disco\Helper\SampleService;

#[Configuration]
class MyConfiguration
{
     #[Bean]
    public function mySampleService() : SampleService
    {
        return new SampleService();
    }
}
```

Beans with a `public` visibility can be retrieved via the `\bitExpert\Disco\AnnotationBeanFactory`. Beans with a `protected` visibility are so-called internal dependencies and thus cannot be retrieved via the `\bitExpert\Disco\AnnotationBeanFactory`.

Public methods of the configuration class have to while protected classes may be marked with the `#[Bean]` attribute. The `\bitExpert\Disco\AnnotationBeanFactory` will throw an exception when public methods without a `#[Bean]` annotation are found.

## PSR-11

Disco implements the [PSR-11](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/) interface. That means you can use Disco in any application that can deal with PSR-11 containers, e.g., [Mezzio](https://docs.mezzio.dev/).

In a nutshell the container-interop project provides a interface for DI containers that consists of two methods: `get()` & `has()`.

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Psr\Container;

/**
 * Describes the interface of a container that exposes methods to read its entries.
 */
interface ContainerInterface
{
    /**
     * Finds an entry of the container by its identifier and returns it.
     *
     * @param string $id Identifier of the entry to look for.
     *
     * @throws NotFoundExceptionInterface  No entry was found for **this** identifier.
     * @throws ContainerExceptionInterface Error while retrieving the entry.
     *
     * @return mixed Entry.
     */
    public function get(string $id);

    /**
     * Returns true if the container can return an entry for the given identifier.
     * Returns false otherwise.
     *
     * `has($id)` returning true does not mean that `get($id)` will not throw an exception.
     * It does however mean that `get($id)` will not throw a `NotFoundExceptionInterface`.
     *
     * @param string $id Identifier of the entry to look for.
     *
     * @return bool
     */
    public function has(string $id): bool;
}
```

The caller can retrieve an instance via calling the `get()` method. The `$id` passed to get needs either to be a method name declaring a bean instance or an alias or a bean method.

The call to `has()` simply checks if potentially a dependency by the given `$id` exists. In theory the call to `get()` for the same `$id` can still fail when an error occurs during the instantiation phase of the bean.
