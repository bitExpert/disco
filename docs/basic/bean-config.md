# Bean Configuration

The `#[Bean]` attribute comes with a few options which influence how beans are created or how their internal state will be kept during different requests.

## Singleton Beans

By default a bean instance is configured to be returned as a singleton instance which means multiple calls to `\bitExpert\Disco\AnnotationBeanFactory::get()` will retrieve the very same instance. The explicit bean configuration to return singleton instances would read as follows:

```php
<?php

use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Bean;
use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Configuration;
use bitExpert\Disco\Helper\SampleService;

#[Configuration]
class MyConfiguration
{
    #[Bean(singleton: true)]
    public function mySampleService() : SampleService
    {
        return new SampleService();
    }
}
```

In case you explicitly want to return a new instance for every
`\bitExpert\Disco\AnnotationBeanFactory::get()` call, set the singleton option to `false`.

```php
<?php

use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Bean;
use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Configuration;
use bitExpert\Disco\Helper\SampleService;

#[Configuration]
class MyConfiguration
{
    #[Bean(singleton: false)]
    public function mySampleService() : SampleService
    {
        return new SampleService();
    }
}
```

## Lazy Beans

By default, Disco will return non-lazy bean instances, which means you will get the exact same instance as you have defined in your configuration code. The explicit bean configuration to return non-lazy instances would read as follows:

```php
<?php

use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Bean;
use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Configuration;
use bitExpert\Disco\Helper\SampleService;

#[Configuration]
class MyConfiguration
{
    #[Bean(lazy: false)]
    public function mySampleService() : SampleService
    {
        return new SampleService();
    }
}
```

In case the construction of your bean is quite time-consuming — e.g., a call to a remote service is made — you can instruct Disco to return a lazy instance of your bean, the concrete instance gets created upon the first method call. Simply set the lazy option to `true` to let Disco wrap your bean as a lazy instance:

```php
<?php

use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Bean;
use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Configuration;
use bitExpert\Disco\Helper\SampleService;

#[Configuration]
class MyConfiguration
{
    #[Bean(lazy: true)]
    public function mySampleService() : SampleService
    {
        return new SampleService();
    }
}
```

For the lazy bean management Disco uses [ocramius/proxy-manager](https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager), so the same rules apply for Disco as for Proxy Manager when it comes to creating
lazy instances. 

For example you are not able to return a lazy instance of a final class as the class cannot be extended — which is the basic principle when it comes to creating lazy instances.

## Bean Scopes

Beans in Disco can either live in the request scope or the session scope. Request scoped beans are created newly for every new request, whilst session scoped beans persist beyond a page refresh.

Disco itself is not responsible for managing session state in any way but will allow you to grab session instances from the container, persists them and retrieve them during the new request.

By default beans are request scoped which means a new instance gets created for every new request:

```php
<?php

use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Bean;
use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Configuration;
use bitExpert\Disco\Helper\SampleService;

#[Configuration]
class MyConfiguration
{
    #[Bean(scope: Bean::SCOPE_REQUEST)]
    public function mySampleService() : SampleService
    {
        return new SampleService();
    }
}
```

To let Disco create a session scoped bean, simply set the `scope` attribute to `session`:

```php
<?php

use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Bean;
use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Configuration;
use bitExpert\Disco\Helper\SampleService;

#[Configuration]
class MyConfiguration
{
    #[Bean(scope: Bean::SCOPE_SESSION)]
    public function mySampleService() : SampleService
    {
        return new SampleService();
    }
}
```

Read in the advanced section of the documentation what else is needed to let session scoped beans persist beyond a page refresh.

## Bean Aliases

Using class method names as bean identifiers is a simple way to avoid naming collisions as your IDE will warn you in case you define multiple methods with the same name.

As a drawback you are quite limited when it comes to bean names. To quote the [PHP manual](http://php.net/manual/en/functions.user-defined.php):

> A valid function name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores.

This led to introducing aliases for beans. Each bean can have multiple aliases and two types of aliases are possible: 
a name alias `#[Alias]` or a type alias `#[TypeAlias]`.

In case of collisions (the same alias is used for different beans) Disco will throw an exception.
You're asked to avoid/resolve such conflicts. Since version 0.10.0 of Disco collision detection will only take the configuration class into account the alias is defined in, this allows you to overwrite aliases in child configuration.

Simply attribute the Bean with `#[Alias(name: 'some_alias')]` to define a named alias or `#[TypeAlias]` to define the return type as an aliases.
Multiple name aliases are allowed. 

```php
<?php

use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Alias;
use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Bean;
use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Configuration;
use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\TypeAlias;
use bitExpert\Disco\Helper\SampleService;

#[Configuration]
class MyConfiguration
{
    #[Bean]
    #[Alias(name: '\Identifier\With\Namespace')]
    #[TypeAlias]
    public function mySampleService() : SampleService
    {
        return new SampleService();
    }
}
```

Now you can either pass `mySampleService` or `\Identifier\With\Namespace` or `bitExpert\Disco\Helper\SampleService` to the `\bitExpert\Disco\AnnotationBeanFactory::get()` or `\bitExpert\Disco\AnnotationBeanFactory::has()` calls.

The example uses both available alias types. Let's look at them one after the other.

### Named Alias

`#[Alias(name: '\Identifier\With\Namespace')]`

This alias type is pretty much self explaining. What you define as name can later be used to get the service from the bean factory.

### Return Type Alias

`#[TypeAlias]`

Using thy `#[TypeAlias]` attribute tells Disco to use the return type of the method as an alias.

This is very useful because you can work with PHP's `::class` language construct like in this example: `$annotationBeanFactory->get(SampleService::class)`.

If you now refactor `SampleService` (rename or move to other namespace) a modern IDE will automatically change the alias and your code continues to work. Classes or interfaces can be used as an alias as well as PHP's native types like _array_, _bool_, _int_, _float_, _string_.

### Mix and Match

You can use many named aliases and/or one type alias per bean. Aliases also work for protected beans, exposing the bean by the given alias but not by their method name!
