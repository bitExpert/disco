# bitexpert/disco

This package provides a [PSR-11](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/) compatible, annotation-based dependency injection container. Have a look at the [disco-demos](https://github.com/bitExpert/disco-demos) project to find out how to use Disco.

## Installation

The preferred way of installing `bitexpert/disco` is through Composer.
You can add `bitexpert/disco` as a dependency, as follows:

```
composer.phar require bitexpert/disco
```

## Usage

To instantiate Disco use the following code in your bootstrapping logic.
Create an instance of the `\bitExpert\Disco\AnnotationBeanFactory` and register the instance with the `\bitExpert\Disco\BeanFactoryRegistry`.
The second step is important as Disco needs to grab the active container instance in a few locations where it does not have access to the container instance itself.

```php
<?php

$beanFactory = new \bitExpert\Disco\AnnotationBeanFactory(MyConfiguration::class);
\bitExpert\Disco\BeanFactoryRegistry::register($beanFactory);
```

Next up you need to create a configuration class `MyConfiguration` and document it with a `@Configuration` annotation.

```php
<?php

use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Configuration;

#[Configuration]
class MyConfiguration
{
}
```

To declare a configuration entry, 1) add a method to your `MyConfiguration` class, and 2) annotate the method with the `@Bean` annotation.
Doing this registers the instance with Disco and uses the type specified by the method’s return value. The primary identifier is the method name:

```php
<?php

use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Bean;
use bitExpert\Disco\Annotations\Configuration;
use bitExpert\Disco\Helper\SampleService;

#[Configuration]
class MyConfiguration
{
     #[Bean]
    public function mySampleService() : SampleService
    {
        return new SampleService();
    }
}
```

To let Disco return the entry with the id `mySampleService` call the `get()` method of `\bitExpert\Disco\AnnotationBeanFactory`, as follows:

```php
<?php

$beanFactory->get('mySampleService');
```
